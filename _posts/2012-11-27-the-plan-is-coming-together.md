These have been an incredible few days! We have a growing number of subscribers and interest from many high-quality authors to publish on the site. Thank you all - again!</p> <p>I also would like to thank DZone who <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/be-part-java-advent-calendar-0">joined the cause</a> of creating the Java Advent Calendar.</p> <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/be-part-java-advent-calendar-0" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="DZone logo" border="0" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Q1AC2iiPrXg/ULSRcC9bfbI/AAAAAAAAFkk/zN3NNHA02qQ/s1600/mh_dzone_logo.png" title="DZone" /></a></div> <p>We can't rest on our laurels however! So here is a more detailed plan for the next couple of days:</p> <ul><li>We still need authors! Want to write <em>one</em> post? <a href="mailto:dify.ltd@gmail.com">Contact me</a> - or if you have a friend who would enjoy writing an article, urge her/him to contact me.</li><li>Stretch goal: get one author from every continent!</li><li>We are now social (thanks to Marco for the suggestion)! Follow/share the blog on <a href="https://twitter.com/JavaAdvent">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/109896931373578063453/109896931373578063453/posts">Google+</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Java-Advent-Calendar/229536173843473?ref=hl#">Facebook</a>!</li></ul> <p>Four more days to the first article!</p>
